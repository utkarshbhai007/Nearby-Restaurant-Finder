Restaurant discovery and navigation are essential aspects of modern urban living. With the growing number of restaurants and diverse culinary offerings, users seek convenient, real-time tools to locate nearby food options, read reviews, and navigate effortlessly. Additionally, restaurant owners require platforms where they can manage their listings, attract new customers, and respond to feedback.
To meet these needs, this project— “Nearby Restaurant Finder”—proposes a web-based platform that enables users to:
1.	Discover restaurants using an interactive, location-based map.
2.	Search for restaurants by location and category.
3.	View restaurant details, ratings, and reviews.
4.	Navigate to restaurants using integrated map directions.
5.	Allow restaurant owners to register and manage their listings.
This system leverages modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, Supabase, and OpenLayers to deliver a responsive, scalable, and user-friendly experience for both diners and restaurant managers.

1.2 Purpose
The core purpose of this application is to offer a centralized, interactive platform that simplifies restaurant discovery for users while enabling restaurant owners to manage their online presence effectively.
Addressed Challenges:
•	Difficulty in finding nearby restaurants with specific cuisine or ratings.
•	Lack of visual, map-based restaurant discovery tools.
•	Limited platforms for restaurant owners to manage their listings without third-party aggregators.
•	Inefficient search and filtering in traditional restaurant listing websites.

•	Real-time restaurant location on maps.
•	Easy-to-use interface for both end users and restaurant owners.
•	Secure authentication and management of user and owner accounts.
•	Detailed insights via rating and review integration.

1.3 Scope
The Restaurant Map Application encompasses the following:
•	User Authentication: Secure sign-up, login, and session management for users and restaurant owners.
•	Restaurant Management: Ability for owners to register their restaurants, add details, update menus, and manage reviews.
•	Interactive Map Interface: Built with OpenLayers to display restaurants based on user location.
•	Location-Based Services: Dynamic filtering of restaurants based on proximity and preferences.
•	Review & Rating System: Users can leave ratings and reviews to share experiences.
•	Responsive Design: Optimized for multiple devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
•	Navigation Support: Map-based directions to the selected restaurants.
 1.4 Objective
